        <h2>Services I have rendered</h2>
        <ul id="expert">
            <li>Scheduling and Calendar Management: Effective time management is critical for productivity. By managing your calendar, I ensure that your time is allocated optimally to balance work and personal commitments. This includes scheduling appointments, meetings, and events while avoiding conflicts. I also send reminders for important dates and deadlines, allowing you to focus on your priorities without worrying about missing crucial engagements. </li>
            <li>Email Management and Organization: Managing a cluttered inbox can be time-consuming. I help by organizing your email, categorizing messages into folders, flagging important emails for follow-up, and filtering spam or unnecessary content. For routine or straightforward queries, I draft or send prompt replies on your behalf. This ensures a streamlined email system where every message is addressed in a timely and organized manner.</li>
            <li>Data Entry and Data Management: Accurate data entry is essential for informed decision-making. I handle the task of inputting data into spreadsheets or databases, ensuring precision and consistency. Beyond entry, I also manage data by organizing it in a structured format, performing quality checks, and keeping records up-to-date. This makes retrieval and analysis straightforward and efficient.</li>
            <li>Travel Planning and Coordination: Travel can be stressful without proper planning. I simplify this by managing every aspect of your journey, from booking flights, hotels, and rental cars to creating detailed itineraries. I also handle documentation, such as visas or travel insurance, and monitor travel updates to adjust plans if needed. With all arrangements taken care of, your travel experience is seamless and stress-free.</li>
            <li>Book-keeping and Financial Management: Staying on top of finances is vital for both personal and professional success. I assist by maintaining detailed financial records, tracking expenses, and preparing invoices. Additionally, I can generate financial reports to provide insights into spending patterns and ensure that your accounts are balanced and compliant with any financial regulations.</li>
            <li>Social media management: Social media is a powerful tool for branding and engagement. I take care of your social media presence by scheduling and posting content at optimal times to reach your audience. I also engage with followers by responding to comments and messages, analyze performance metrics, and ensure that your accounts reflect a consistent and professional image.</li>
            <li>Customer support: Delivering exceptional customer service fosters trust and loyalty. I handle customer queries and concerns through email, phone, chat, or social media platforms, ensuring that each client receives prompt, friendly, and helpful assistance. Whether resolving complaints or providing product information, I aim to enhance the customer experience and build positive relationships.</li>
